quizzer
=======
An old project that I never even started.

Quizzer is basically my MEAN Stack playground. Probably won't ever be of any use to anyone but myself.  

The goal is to create a quiz application from the ground up with node as a back end, an admin panel with login that allows you to create new quizes, stored in a mongo db and served up in JSON Glory to an Angular front end
